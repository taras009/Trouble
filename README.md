TROUBLE is a simple board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to dice rolls. Play against other players or against AI.

        Rules:

        At the start of the game, the player's four pieces are placed in the start area of their colour.
        Players take it in turn to throw a die. A player must first throw a six to be able to move a piece from the starting area onto the starting square. In each subsequent turn the player moves a piece forward 1 to 6 squares as indicated by the die. When a player throws a 6 the player may bring a new piece onto the starting square, or may choose to move a piece already in play. The player is also granted another turn as a bonus, but if a 6 is rolled three times in a row it is counted as a foul and the player therefore loses her turn.
        If a player gets a 6 they can separate chances (the player can separate 6 on one piece and 3 on the other if they get a 6 and a 3, if the pieces are already out of the house). The player can also play the numbers (6 & 3) using the same piece in any order. If a player cannot make a valid move they must pass the die to the next player.
        If a player's piece lands on a square containing an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and returns to the starting area. A piece may not land on a square that already contains a piece of the same colour (unless playing doubling rules; see below).
        Once a piece has completed a circuit of the board it moves up the home column of its own colour. The player must throw the exact number to advance to the home square. The winner is the first to get all four of their pieces onto the home square.
